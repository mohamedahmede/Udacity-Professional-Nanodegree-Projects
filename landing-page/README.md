At first I asssigned my Global variables that I am going to use through out the project and there names are:
 -sections
 -mySectionsList
 -numberOfSections

 then I made a function to create nav list and it edits it's inner html so that it gets a name and get linked

 and my final function it activates each section depending on the viewport using a built in function.
